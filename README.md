# Work Day Schedule

An application created as a schedule for a work day from 9am to 5 pm

## Description

This application is a work-day schedule in which the user types their daily events or tasks into a schedule organized by hour. The user input gets saved into local storage and will appear even through reloading the application. The past hours will display as grey, the current hour red, and the future hours green. The creation of the application involved styling with Bootstrap, time tracking with DayJS, and implementing functionality with jQuery. This increased understanding of third-party APIs.
